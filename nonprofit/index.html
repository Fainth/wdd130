                <p style="flex:1;">Managing Attorney, The Americas Law Group, PLLC Thirty nine (yes, its been 39!) years ago this coming October, 2017, a short time after being sworn in to his first “Bar” in 1978, Lance launched his career  defending and litigating the constitutional rights of U.S. Citizens in federal courts. The best description of Lance’s work is “problem solver” . That role led to work internationally and domestically as litigation and general counsel to various corporate and individual clients and causes to solve the legal, logistical and political problems of mergers, acquisitions, immigration, criminal and trade transactions in the Americas and Europe. He is frequently referred to as the scrappy street lawyer never giving up until he finds a way to solve the problem for the clients and causes he gets involved in.</p>
